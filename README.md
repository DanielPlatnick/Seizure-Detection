# SeizureDetection

SeizureDetection contains a summary of my work and code done on seizure detection for the Ryerson University LIA (Learning and Inference Algorithms) Lab. This mainly consists of processing and cleaning unstructured datasets like the CHB-MIT dataset, as well as the TUH Seizure Corpus.

TUH_Preprocessing.py is a modification of IBM's code to process the TUH Seizure Corpus, to help run experiments on the data.
